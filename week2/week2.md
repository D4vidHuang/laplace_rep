# Week 2: MLP + Laplace Implementation for MNIST

## Goals
Implement a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Laplace approximation for MNIST classification and evaluate its uncertainty estimation capabilities.

## Expected Outcomes
1. Working MLP model with Laplace approximation
2. Confidence scores for in-distribution (MNIST) and out-of-distribution samples
3. AUROC scores for OOD detection
4. Comparative analysis with baseline methods

## Timeline
- Day 1-2: Model implementation and training
- Day 3-4: Laplace approximation implementation
- Day 5: Evaluation and analysis
- Day 6-7: Documentation and refinement

## Dependencies
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- scikit-learn (for metrics)
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## Notes
1. Use random seed 42 for reproducibility
2. Save model checkpoints regularly
3. Document any hyperparameter choices
4. Keep track of training metrics
5. Regular team sync-ups for progress updates
