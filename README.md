# Laplace Project Reproduction

This repository contains a reproduction of the Laplace project, which focuses on implementing and experimenting with Laplace approximation methods for neural networks.

## Overview

Laplace approximation is a method for approximating the posterior distribution of neural network parameters. This implementation provides tools and experiments for:

- Computing the Laplace approximation of neural network parameters
- Evaluating the quality of uncertainty estimates
- Comparing different approximation methods
- Running experiments on various datasets

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Basic usage example:

```python
from src.laplace import LaplaceApproximation
from src.models import YourModel

# Initialize your model
model = YourModel()

# Create Laplace approximation
la = LaplaceApproximation(model)

# Fit the approximation
la.fit(train_loader)

# Get uncertainty estimates
predictions, uncertainties = la.predict(test_loader)
```

## Experiments

To run experiments:

```bash
python experiments/run_experiment.py --config experiments/configs/default.yaml
```
